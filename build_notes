Here the build procedure that works for me (based on comments in the source and the website, https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream).

To build 100M version:
gcc -O -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=100000000 stream.c -o stream.100M

To build with OpenMP support (for using multiple threads):
gcc -O -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=100000000 -fopenmp -D_OPENMP stream.c -o stream.100M.openmp

Then you can run with 8 threads using:
OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./stream.100M.openmp

Make sure you see these lines in the output:
Number of Threads requested = 8
